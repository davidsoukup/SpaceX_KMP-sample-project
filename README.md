# KMP Sample project & playground

This repository contains a personal Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) project, created as a demo and playground for my own learning and experimentation. It demonstrates a basic setup for sharing code between Android and iOS, showcasing how to structure a multiplatform project, implement shared business logic, and integrate platform-specific features. This project serves as a hands-on environment to explore KMP concepts, test ideas, and refine my understanding of Kotlin Multiplatform development.
